# Inspector Gadget

## About

Inspector Gadget is a simple web app that you can use to get a lot of info on the web server where it's running (the *inspector*) and perform additional tasks (the *gadgets*) from there.

## Usage

You can either use the simple [default.aspx](Page/default.aspx) page that you can simply drop in any Windows and ASP.NET Framework based host (like IIS or Azure App Service), or you can deploy the more elaborate .NET Core based [web app](WebApp) on Windows or Linux (published to the host directly or as a container).
